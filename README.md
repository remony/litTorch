# litTorch



A simple lightweight torch app for Android.

This app uses the camera led flash to provide a torch, there is a single button to operate the app with nothing else to it. Minimsing the app will close the camera so other apps will be able to use the camera.


## Purpose

There is little to it, no graphics, no ads, just pure performance.
